**ReqTector is a **powerful and minimal** macOS network debugging tool designed for developers and engineers to **capture, inspect, and analyze** HTTP/HTTPS requests in real time.**

## Features

✔️ **Capture All API Requests & Logs**  
Monitor network traffic from **URLSession, Alamofire, or NetworkExtension**, logging all incoming and outgoing requests.  

✔️ **Real-time Request & Response Logging**  
View detailed request and response data, including **headers, payload, status codes, and response times**.  

✔️ **Advanced Filtering & Search**  
Easily find specific API calls by **endpoint, status code, request method, or response time**.  

✔️ **Export & Debugging Tools**  
Export API logs in **JSON/CSV format** for deeper debugging and analysis.  

✔️ **Minimal & Intuitive UI**  
A macOS-native UI designed for **efficiency and ease of use**.  


## Development Roadmap

### **Phase 1: Core Development**
- [x] Project Setup, UI Design
- [ ] Proxy Mechanism  
- [ ] Intercept Network Traffic (Capture API Requests)  
- [ ] Implement Request & Response Logging  

### **Phase 2: UI Enhancements & Filtering**
- [x] Build Interactive UI & Filtering System  
- [ ] Implement Advanced Debugging Tools  
- [ ] Optimize Performance & Memory Usage  

### **Phase 3: Exporting & Open Source Release**

- [ ] Prepare for **GitHub Open Source Release**  


## Technologies Used

- **Swift, SwiftUI, Combine** – Core development 
- **URLProtocol, NetworkExtension** – Network interception  
- **CoreData / SQLite** – Data storage  
- **Alamofire** (optional) – For networking layer  

### Alternative Development Approaches
- Enhance **network monitoring** to **packet capture level** (Wireshark-like approach).  
- Develop as a **VPN proxy** to capture all **network traffic system-wide**.
